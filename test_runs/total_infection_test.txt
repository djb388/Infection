#  A demonstration of infection algorithms      #
#  which 'infect' a subset of a population.     #
#  The population represents the users of a     #
#  website, and the infection represents the    #
#  spread of updates to the website.            #
#                                               #

Infection menu; enter an option:

 1) Print website version for a user's cluster
    -Prints the website version of all members in a
     specific user's cluster

 2) Run total_infection on a specific user

 3) Run limited_infection

 4) Run tiered_infection

    -Infects all users, dividing 4 website versions among
     approximately 5%, 10%, 15%, and 70% of the population.

 5) Verify total_infection functionality
    -Runs total_infection on 10 random users, comparing
     its results to the clustering algorithm.

 6) Verify limited_infection functionality
    -Runs limited_infection 10 times, comparing its
     results to the clustering algorithm.
