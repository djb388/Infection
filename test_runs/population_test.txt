#  A demonstration of infection algorithms      #
#  which 'infect' a subset of a population.     #
#  The population represents the users of a     #
#  website, and the infection represents the    #
#  spread of updates to the website.            #
#                                               #

 1) Print population statistics

 2) Cluster population and print cluster metadata

 3) Change number of users
    -Controls the user population size

 4) Change max class size
    -Sets the upper bound of the coaches relation

 5) Change student ratio adjustment
    -Bigger numbers reduce the number of large
     coaches relations (3-6 are typically ideal)
